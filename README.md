## üÜï What's New in v1.1.0

### Portfolio Overview Dashboard
The major new feature in v1.1.0 is the Portfolio Overview Dashboard, which provides a comprehensive summary of your entire loan portfolio's Bitcoin performance. This dashboard aggregates all individual loan analyses into a single, easy-to-understand overview.

#### How the Portfolio Dashboard Works
1. **Automatic Detection**: Monitors all loan cards on the Firefish.io page
2. **Real-time Aggregation**: Collects data from individual loan analyses as they complete
3. **Portfolio Metrics**: Calculates total theoretical gain/loss across all loans
4. **Performance Summary**: Shows how many loans are outperforming vs underperforming
5. **Portfolio Value**: Displays total loan amount value being analyzed
6. **Live Updates**: Dashboard updates in real-time as new analyses complete

#### Key Portfolio Metrics
- **Total Theoretical Gain/Loss**: Sum of net BTC strategy results across all analyzed loans
- **Loan Count Summary**: Number of outperforming loans vs total analyzed loans
- **Portfolio Value**: Total sum of loan amounts for analyzed loans
- **Performance Status**: Visual indicators for positive/negative overall performance

## v1.0.0 Features

### Bitcoin Performance Analysis
The major feature in v1.0.0 is comprehensive Bitcoin performance analysis for Firefish.io loan collateral. This feature helps users understand whether their BTC collateral strategy is outperforming traditional loan interest costs.

#### How the BTC Analyzer Works
1. **Loan Detection**: Automatically detects Firefish.io loan cards on the page
2. **Price Fetching**: Retrieves historical BTC prices from CoinGecko API for loan provision dates
3. **Current Prices**: Gets real-time BTC prices for comparison
4. **Investment Comparison**: Calculates what if the loan amount was used to buy BTC instead
5. **Performance Analysis**: Shows whether BTC investment would outperform loan interest costs
6. **Visual Results**: Displays comprehensive analysis with tooltips and explanations

#### Key Calculations
- **BTC Value Change**: `Loan Amount √ó (Current BTC Price / Historical BTC Price - 1)`
- **Loan Interest Cost**: `Loan Amount √ó Interest Rate`
- **Theoretical Gain/Loss**: `BTC Value Change - Loan Interest Cost`
- **Performance Status**: Outperforming if BTC gain > loan interest cost
